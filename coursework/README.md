# Module coursework for deep learning for audio and music

For more information about this coursework, read: [INFO.md](https://github.com/pranigopu/deepLearning--for--audio-music/blob/4e33739eea581d1f131ba4cc03d926456157d027/coursework/INFO.md)

## Proposed project

The 2 DL inferences:

- Major/minor classifier (using CNN)
- Time signature classifier (using RNN)

Inference combinations (of the above 2 DL inferences):

- Single CNN model
- Composite model
- Sequential CNN model (output of time signature as input to major/minor classifier)

_Compare the outcomes of the above 3._
