# Paper presentation
As a part of the deep learning for audio and music course, we students have to present a paper of our choice (either live or in video, with a live Q & A in either case). My chosen paper is "Piano Skills Assessment" by Paritosh Parmar, Jaiden Reddy and Brendan Morris. I chose this paper due to the following reasons:

- My experience in piano assessment (as a student)
- The relevance of such an application (ex. personal performance evaluation to help self-improvement)
- The interesting complexity of the problem of automating musical evaluation

# Notes on the chosen paper
## Driving questions
- Can a computer assess piano player's skill level?
- Visual analysis or auditory analysis?
- How to sample shorter clips to best reflect player performance
    - **CONTEXT**: Long videos are difficult for CNNs to process
